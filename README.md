 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a machine learning approach. It leverages a dataset of customer information and applies preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models to identify customers likely to stop using a service.

🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses to monitor and reduce. In this project, we build a predictive model that classifies customers as likely to churn or not based on various attributes like tenure, contract type, payment method, and more.
